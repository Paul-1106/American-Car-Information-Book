<h2>Background: </h2>
For this project, I am going to use Jupyter Notebook, MongoDB, and C++ to create a car list. Each columns will be based on the car brand, car model, the year it was made, the car's type, horsepower, acceleration from 0 mph to 60 mph, amount of gas it can hold if it is a gas car, the maximum speed, and drivetrain. All of the queries will be inside of a CSV file which will also be in this repository. In the future, I will add more cars once this project is fully functional and was able to complete the right steps. <br><br>

<h2>Requirements: </h2>
Programming Language: C++<br>
Database: MongoDB<br>
File: CSV<br>
IDE: Jupyter Notebook<br>
C++ compiler (G++)<br><br>
(updating the list of requirements)<br><br>

<h2>CRUD method: </h2>
This project will be created with a functionality of using a CRUD method (Create, Read, Update, Delete).<br><br>
<h3>:pencil2: C = Create:</h3>
The create method will add a car query to the list. A user will need to input the brand, model, year, type, horsepower amount, acceleration, amount of gas it can hold, is it electric, the maximum speed, and the drivetrain.<br><br>
<h3>📖 R = Read:</h3>
Read is also known for searching for a query. A user will expect to search for a query by inputting either column names.<br><br>
<h3>♻️ U = Update:</h3>
Users can modify a query by changing the name, type, max speed, etc. They can only edit a query one at a time.<br><br>
<h3>🗑️ D = Delete:</h3>
The delete method will allow users to remove a query from the list permanently. They can do that by inputting the car ID only.<br><br>

<h2>The Goal: </h2>
The goal to create a Jupyter Notebook Dashboard of where I can create a website data. By using a dashboard, users can use a filter for all usa cars on the list and it will allow to change the graph or data.<br><br>

<h2>Jupyter Page: </h2>
